              We are thus a Sacco of the diaspora, for the diaspora by the diaspora. We are uniquely close to the challenges faced by Kenyans working overseas. From fraud, lack of access to capital and credit, intricate market dynamics to weak management, our founders and management are intimately familiar with these challenges having experienced them themselves. We are inspired and ferociously driven by the relentless desire to not only address these challenges and ensure no other non-resident Kenyans undeservedly lose their hard-earned income but to also create sustainable alternatives. We therefore create products and services uniquely tailored to the needs of these hardworking individuals as well as make investments with sustainable risk-adjusted returns. Our operating objective is thus to not only create a platform that affords our members convenient access to credit but also facilitates wealth growth through interest earning savings and investments.
